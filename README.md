<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines)
- Remote Desktop


<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)



<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<p>
The first step for creating a virtual machine in Azure is to first create a resource group once logged into account. A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an azure solution, and it is where the VM will be managed from.

After successfully creating the resource group in which the VM will be housed in, the second step is to create the actual VM in Azure. The deployment should be a fairly easy step

The third step will consist of creating the VM and making a few selecetions such as region and choosing windows version.This step is pretty much like a customization of what capabilities the VM will have some for example what windows version will it run on as well as memory size and so on.

Finally after successfully choosing and creating the VM's specifictaions the VM should be up and running in Azure, the image above is an example of a running virtual machine. Creating a VM in Azure(cloud) is a good way to practice on task such as remoting into the virtual machine as it is something real life I.T technicians do on the day to day basis to trouble shoot certain issues for end users.
