The first step for creating a virtual machine in Azure is to first create a resource group. A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an azure solution, and it is where the VM will be managed from.

After successfully creating the resource group in which the VM will be housed in, the second step is to create the actual VM in Azure you can either select the virtual machine icon or you can simply type it in the search bar. Once there you will click on the create icon and the process should start after that.

The third step will consist of making a few selections for that VM such as choosing windows version type as well as it's memory size.

Finally after successfully choosing and creating the VM's specifictaions the VM should be up and running in Azure, the image above is an example of a running virtual machine. Creating a VM in Azure is a good way to get some practice on essentially "building" a computer in the cloud and creating tasks or running multiple environments from one place.
